# Write a function called 'city_country()' that takes in the name of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:
# 'Santiago, Chile'
# Call your function with at least three city-country pairs, and print the values that are returned

def city_country(city, country):
    """This function should return a formatted string"""
    print(f"\nLooks like you have been to {city.title()}, {country.title()}")

city_country('london', 'france')
city_country('cairo', 'egypt')
city_country('new york city', 'united states of america')
