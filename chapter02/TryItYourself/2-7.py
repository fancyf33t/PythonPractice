# Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip()

words = '  this has whitespace  '
print(words)
print(words.strip()) # now it is gone

# "\t" = tab
# "\n" = new line
