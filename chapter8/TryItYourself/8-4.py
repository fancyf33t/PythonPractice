# Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads I love Python. Make a large shirt and a medium shirt witht he default message, and a shirt of any size with a different message

# i already did this but hey.... i can only improve by practicing

def make_shirt(size='large', message='I love Python'):
    """Make messages for the shirts"""
    print(f"\nIt looks like you are wearing a {size} shirt.")
    print(f"The message on the {size} shirt is: {message}.")

make_shirt()
make_shirt('small', 'I kinda like java')
